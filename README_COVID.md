SQL---Covid-19-Data-Exploration

This is a SQL portfolio project to demonstrate how raw data is queried and formatted to understand the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic during its peak.

For this project, a subset of the available data for both infections and vaccinations were studied and compared to derive patterns and draw compelling conclusions. (Dataset link https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.)

In this project, the dataset was divided into two .xlsx files: Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations. These were imported to create two tables in the database/schema. I utilized BigQuery for this analysis, therefore some queries will have superficial differences to other tools, albeit the same execution.

Project goals:
• Investigating Total Cases vs Total Deaths • Investigating Total Cases vs Population • Highest Infection Rate per country • Highest Death Count per population • Highest Death Count per continent • Global Numbers • Examining Total Population vs Vaccinations

Skills used throughout this project:
• Joins • CTE's • Temp Tables • Windows Functions • Aggregate Functions • Creating Views • Converting Data Types
